# OpenAPI Viewer
This repo contains a Webpage build with Nuxtjs and Vuetify to easily show and switch between multiple OpenAPI descriptions.

The data comes from different APIs:
* [BundDEV - API](https://api.bund.dev)
* [Geoportal - API](https://t-huyeng.github.io/geoportal-openapis/)

## Background
This page was mainly developed to show the rather big amount of OpenAPI files from the Geoportals of Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland.
