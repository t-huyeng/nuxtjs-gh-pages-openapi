# OpenAPI Viewer 
This repo contains a Webpage build with Nuxtjs and Vuetify to easily show and switch between multiple OpenAPI descriptions. 

The data comes from different APIs: 
* [BundDEV - API](https://api.bund.dev) (currently using this [fork](https://t-huyeng.github.io/bunddev-apis/) until the pull request has been merged)
* [Geoportal - API](https://t-huyeng.github.io/geoportal-openapis/)

## Background
This page was mainly developed to show the rather big amount of OpenAPI files from the Geoportals of Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland.
